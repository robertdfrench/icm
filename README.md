*Introduction to Computational Mathematics*

### Motivation
The goal of this book is to introduce programming and higher mathematics in a combined setting, for
the sake of preparing the reader to further their studies in mathematics, scientific computing, or
engineering.

While some topics may be reminiscent of a text on numerical analysis, the style is intended to
contrast with those efforts by taking a rigorous approach to software engineering, and a less
rigorous approach to the underlying mathematics.

The mathematics presented in this book is entirely constructive, and that is by design; the student
should be able to program their own mathematical universe piece-by-piece as new algorithms are
introduced. The disadvantage of this approach is that continuity will be oversimplified; interested
readers will need to pursue a course in analysis.
